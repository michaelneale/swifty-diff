# Project Requirements

1. I want to continue this app - it is ok and semi functional but: it should always show changes that are not committed in the dir it runs in (staged or not). The timeline feature needs to not have notches below it (be a simple slider). It is slow when clicking on some diffs as it seems to block the gui. it really does need to be updated as files change on disk, it is important it is a fast efficient app.
